          To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use
          "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to
          assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification

          are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal
          information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example

          not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our
          web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of
          our users, to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know
          the geographic locations from where our visitors come.
